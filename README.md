# 📰 Fake News Detection using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)

A deep learning-based project to classify news articles as **fake** or **real** using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**.  
The model is trained on labeled news data and uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and classify text.
